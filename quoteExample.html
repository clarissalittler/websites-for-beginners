      <q>Between these q tags we have a something that will be quoted inline</q> 
      and we can have text that comes after it on the same line.

      Meanwhile this is a blockquote, between blockquote tags, 
      which ensure that this quote is set apart from the rest of the text. 
      Imagine the way news sites or magazine articles will pull 
      quotes into separate paragraphs. That's the point of this.
