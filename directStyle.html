  <body>
    <p style="width: 200px; color: blue;"> So here we have a paragraph of text, like so many before, and we're setting the width directly in the style because we're only going to ever have a single paragraph. Also, at some point, we want just a single of piece of text to get <span style="font-size: 30pt">really big</span> for no discernable reason.</p>
