* Project outline						   :noexport:
** Requirements for a project 
   First, what we need for a project is something that will show
   + some CSS
   + some HTML
   + a very limited amount of JavaScript

this kind of project should be something like a small site that has
   + a menu that drops down and gives options
   + has several columns, each of which is formatted differently
   + uses semantic markup such as
     + =strong=
     + =em=
     + =s=
     + =small=
     + =b=
     + =i=
   + includes both block and inline elements
   + uses a number of divs and spans for marking up text
** Project Idea
*** Your biographic site
    The idea here is that you make a small site that lays out your interests and your hobbies and your life story.
    
    As an example site, let's consider something like the following
    #+BEGIN_SRC html :exports none :tangle MyselfMain.html
      <!doctype html>
      <html>
        <head>
	  <style>
	    .col {
	      height: 90vh; 
	      width: 33%;
	      border: 3px solid black;
	      float: left;
	    }
	    html {
	      min-height: 100%;
	      position: relative;
	    }
	  </style>
        </head>
        <body>
          <header>
            <h1>My Own Domain</h1>
            <p>by Ms. Littler</p>
          </header>

	  <nav>
            <ul>
              <li style="display: inline;"> Biography </li>
              <li style="display: inline;"> Hobbies </li>
              <li style="display: inline;"> Plans for World Domination </li>
            </ul>
          </nav>

          <div class="col">
            asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfsadfasdf
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            asdfsdfsadfasdfsadfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
          </div>
        </body>
      </html>
    #+END_SRC
