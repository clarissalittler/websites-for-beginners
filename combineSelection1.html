      <p>Our first paragraph is here. There's some text and things of that ilk.</p>
      <p class="rebel">This is our second paragraph, beholden to no one but itself. A wild rebel of a paragraph</p>
      <p>Our third paragraph lies here, relentless in its comformity. There's not much to say about ol' thirdy, they're simply stoic and resolute in their paragraphness.</p>
